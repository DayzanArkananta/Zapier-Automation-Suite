# 💼 ClientPulse Dashboard
### Form-to-Relationship Intelligence System

**Workflow:** Google Forms → Groq AI → Notion → Gmail  
**Goal:** Build a mini CRM that reacts intelligently to new client submissions.

---

## 🧠 Overview
ClientPulse Dashboard turns form responses into living client profiles.  
Each submission is automatically processed through **Groq AI**, which determines the respondent’s interest level and business intent.  
Then the system:

1. Adds the data to **Notion CRM** with custom tags (“Premium”, “Trial”, “Cold Lead”).  
2. Sends a **personalized email** follow-up via Gmail.  
3. Logs everything for a weekly digest summary to managers.
