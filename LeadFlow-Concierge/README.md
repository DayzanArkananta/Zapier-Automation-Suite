📫 LeadFlow Concierge
AI-Powered Email-to-CRM Automation for High-Value Leads

Workflow:
Gmail → Groq AI → Google Sheets → Slack

Overview

LeadFlow Concierge turns your messy inbox into a structured, intelligent lead-tracking system.
Whenever a new email arrives containing business keywords like “Order”, “Invoice”, or “Job Application”, the workflow automatically:

Extracts key data — sender name, date, amount, and attachments.

Uses Groq AI to classify the intent (e.g., “Sales”, “Client”, “Invoice”, “Support”).

Creates a new entry in Google Sheets CRM.

Sends a real-time Slack notification with a formatted summary and emoji indicators.

💼 Live notifications keep your team responsive and data-driven.

💡 Ideal for agencies, sales teams, and luxury real estate firms who want lightweight CRM automation.

Unique Edge

Unlike generic Gmail-to-Sheet automations, this system:

Integrates Groq LLM reasoning for human-like classification.

Formats Slack alerts elegantly for client-facing teams.

Can be expanded to connect with HubSpot or Notion CRM instantly.
